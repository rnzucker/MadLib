# MadLib
An attempt to take a PDF file and generate some MadLibs automatically

I just am doing some Python coding for practice. The idea is to take
some text from a provided PDF, and generate a MadLib to be filled in,
as well as a couple with randomly chosen text to replace. The original
plan was to read a webpage, like a newspaper article. But even with
using BeautifulSoup I was going to spend too much time on HTML, CSS,
etc. rather than on Python.

Each run will choose what percentage of the replaced or empty text should be
adverbs, adjectives, verbs, or nouns.
